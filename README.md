# auto_putt_putt 

Create a system that automates the miniature golf process. User places a ball on a board, then uses the GUI to select a golf ball and golf hole. Once selected, the user will press "Hit," the system will then move a cart on a rail and "putt" the ball into the hole. 

System uses 3D printed parts for the cart and rail, MATLAB for Computer Vision and GUI, and Simulink to control servo motors and DC motor through an Arduino MEGA 2560 MCU. 

Worked with Natalia Jenkins, Garrison Veith, and Joseph Page on this project.
